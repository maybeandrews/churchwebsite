                            The Apostle to India
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            St. Thomas, also known as Didymus ("the Twin"), was
                            one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus Christ. He is
                            best known for his initial doubt about Jesus's
                            resurrection, leading to the famous moment when
                            Jesus invited him to touch his wounds, prompting
                            Thomas's confession of faith: "My Lord and my God!"
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As the patron saint of our church, St. Thomas holds
                            special significance for our community in
                            Muvattupuzha. According to tradition, he arrived in
                            India in 52 AD, establishing seven and a half
                            churches in Kerala, and bringing Christianity to the
                            Indian subcontinent.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            St. Thomas is venerated as the Apostle to India and
                            the founder of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church,
                            to which our parish belongs. His missionary zeal,
                            unwavering faith (after his moment of doubt), and
                            martyrdom continue to inspire our congregation
                            today.

                                Born in Galilee, St. Thomas was a fisherman
                                before being called by Jesus to become one of
                                the Twelve Apostles. His name in Aramaic
                                (Tau'ma) means "twin," and he was also called
                                Didymus, the Greek word for twin.

                                decided to return to Judea despite dangers,
                                Thomas said to the other disciples, "Let us also
                                go, that we may die with him" (John 11:16).

                                told of this, he said, "Unless I see the nail
                                marks in his hands... I will not believe." Eight
                                days later, Jesus appeared, inviting Thomas to
                                touch his wounds, leading to Thomas's profound
                                confession of faith.

                        St. Thomas's journey from doubt to faith continues to
                        resonate with Christians today. His story teaches us
                        that questioning can lead to deeper understanding and
                        stronger belief. As our patron saint, he reminds us that
                        faith often requires personal encounter and experience.

                        The Mar Thoma Nazranis (St. Thomas Christians) of Kerala
                        trace their origins to the apostle's mission work. Our
                        church continues this ancient tradition, preserving the
                        liturgical and spiritual heritage brought by St. Thomas
                        to India nearly two millennia ago.
